"C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp"

In Windows 10:

1) Create a regular, plain text file named myscript.txt, for example.

2) As its contents, insert this: sh scriptname.sh. Save and close.

3) Rename this file to myscript.bat then, with your Windows Explorer, locate the file at the filesystem folder, right click on it and select "copy".

4) Yet on Windows Explorer, go to <ROOT>\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp and right click on it. Then select "paste shortcut" (you will need Administration rights to do it).

It's done. Every time your windows starts it runs your bash.
